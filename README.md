# Carbon_Prediction 

This project proposes the development of a CO2 Emission Pattern Detection system that utilizes 
machine learning algorithms to predict and analyze carbon levels based on historical data of 
global CO2 emissions, country-wise CO2 emissions, and sector-wise CO2 emissions. The 
system is designed to predict carbon levels and current carbon levels using a deep learning 
algorithm, which is known for its ability to model sequential data. The predicted carbon levels 
are displayed through graphical representations, allowing users to easily visualize and 
understand the data.
